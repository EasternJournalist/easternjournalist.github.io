I am currently a master candidate at [School of Computer Science and Techonology, University of Science and Technology of China](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), advised by Prof. [Xin Tong](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xtong/) and Prof. [Guan-zhong Sun](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~gzsun/). Besides, I have been a research intern in [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) since July 2021, working closely with [Dr. Jiaolong Yang](https://jlyang.org/) and Prof. Xin Tong.

Now I am studying and exploring modern computer vision & graphics. My research directions includes digital human body synthesis, virtual reality applications and generative 3D synthesis.
