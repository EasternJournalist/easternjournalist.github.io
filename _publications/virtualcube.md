abstract: "The VirtualCube system is a 3D video conference system that attempts to overcome some limitations of conventional
technologies. The key ingredient is VirtualCube, an abstract representation of a real-world cubicle instrumented with RGBD cameras
for capturing the user’s 3D geometry and texture. We design VirtualCube so that the task of data capturing is standardized and
significantly simplified, and everything can be built using off-the-shelf hardware. We use VirtualCubes as the basic building blocks of a
virtual conferencing environment, and we provide each VirtualCube user with a surrounding display showing life-size videos of remote
participants. To achieve real-time rendering of remote participants, we develop the V-Cube View algorithm, which uses multi-view
stereo for more accurate depth estimation and Lumi-Net rendering for better rendering quality. The VirtualCube system correctly
preserves the mutual eye gaze between participants, allowing them to establish eye contact and be aware of who is visually paying
attention to them. The system also allows a participant to have side discussions with remote participants as if they were in the same
room. Finally, the system sheds lights on how to support the shared space of work items (e.g., documents and applications) and track
participants’ visual attention to work items"
